The World Wide Competitive Eating tournament is going to be held in
  your town, and you're the one who is responsible for keeping track
  of time. For the great finale, a large billboard of the given width
  will be installed on the main square, where the time of possibly
  new world record will be shown.

The track of time will be kept by a float number. It will be displayed
  on the board with the set precision precision with center alignment,
  and it is guaranteed that it will fit in the screen. Your task is to
  test the billboard. Given the time t, the width of the screen and the
  precision with which the time should be displayed, return a string
  that should be shown on the billboard.
