"""
You decided to found your own startup company and now want to choose
  a proper name for it. There are three large companies that you want
  to compete against, and since their names are quite popular you want
  to use their names as a starting point. You want to use only popular
  characters in the name of your company, but not too mainstream. You
  consider a character to be popular if it appears in at least two
  company names, and consider it to be mainstream if it appears in all
  three.

Given the names of the companies, return the list of characters that
  are popular but not mainstream sorted by their ASCII codes.
