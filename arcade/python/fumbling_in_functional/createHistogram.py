"""
You noticed that one of your employees has a weird performance rate:
  although his performance is usually good and stable, from time to
  time it drops drastically. You suspect it has something to do with
  the famous Code of Clones series: new episodes started to come out
  recently, and everyone watches and rewatches them every so often.

To confirm your theory, you'd like to create a histogram showing the
  number of assignments he completed each day in the given period.
  Given this data, return a list representing a horizontal histogram,
  where each bar is formed by the given character ch.
