Let's say that number a feels comfortable with number b if a â‰  b and
    b lies in the segment [a - s(a), a + s(a)], where s(x) is the
    sum of x's digits.

How many pairs (a, b) are there, such that a < b, both a and b lie
    on the segment [L, R], and each number feels comfortable with
    the other?
