"""
You work in a company that prints and publishes books. You are
  responsible for designing the page numbering mechanism in the
  printer. You know how many digits a printer can print with the
  leftover ink. Now you want to write a function to determine what
  the last page of the book is that you can number given the current
  page and numberOfDigits left. A page is considered numbered if it
  has the full number printed on it (e.g. if we are working with page
  102 but have ink only for two digits then this page will not be
  considered numbered).

It's guaranteed that you can number the current page, and that you
  can't number the last one in the book.
